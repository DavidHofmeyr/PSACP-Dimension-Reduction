# PSACP-Dimension-Reduction

This three part series will look at some of the aspects of the task of dimension reduction. It will focus only on linear dimension reduction and primarily for unsupervised learning problems. Slides for the presentations, R scripts to play along at home and links to meetings in which the sessions will be streamed will be added to the folders in this repository.

For recordings please contact me to arrange a sharing option as the files are too large to upload to the repository.
