# Monday December 6th, 13:00-14:00
In the first session we will look at
- what exactly is dimension reduction
- some of the reasons we may wish/need to perform dimension reduction
- one of the classical approaches to dimension reduction: Principal Components Analysis (PCA)
We will also play around in R with some robust forms of PCA.
